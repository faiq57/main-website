        I used to have a blog years ago when I was a small human. But it got wiped, presumeable cause I was too small. So, I decided to make a new one right now! How often will I write here? We'll see. Anyways, I'm Faiq, a human that's somewhat bigger than the kid that used to have a blog. Enjoy the photo below of me asking people to be quiet.
